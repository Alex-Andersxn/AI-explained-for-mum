# AI explained for mum

I'm currently an MSc student studying AI and machine learning. One of the most important ethical considerations I've developed for AI is that of AI literacy. While I'm no expert, I believe it's important to share some of the knowledge I've gained.

This repository holds a series of short articles explaining AI concepts that I find interesting, presented in a way that my mum (or anyone unfamiliar with the field) could understand.

Here's what you can expect:

Short, informative articles: Each article focuses on a single AI concept, explained in a clear and concise manner.
Easy-to-understand language: I avoid technical jargon and complex explanations, aiming to make AI accessible to everyone.
Feel free to:

Read and learn about the fascinating world of AI.
Share this repository with others who might be interested.
I'm always looking for feedback and suggestions, so let me know if you have any thoughts or questions!
